 * Authored where item-level price genuinely differs — the wellness trades the
 * customer shops around in. Everything else keeps the category price it always
 * had, because inventing a per-item figure for "Leak Fix" would be precision
 * KAAM cannot back. `serviceDetail` returns null there, and the UI simply
 * shows what it showed before.

/* ── Defined-scope jobs ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These are not "how long did it take" work. An AC service is a known
 * forty-five minute job at a known price; a 2BHK deep clean is priced by the
 * flat, not the clock; a termite treatment is priced by the treatment. Putting
 * them on an hourly ladder invited the same nonsense mehendi had — and it also
 * punishes the fast, experienced worker, who finishes in half the time and
 * earns half as much.
 *
 * What stays on the meter, deliberately: electrician, plumber, mechanic,
 * carpenter, painter. Nobody can price a leak before looking at it, and the
 * per-minute meter is the fairest answer to that — it is KAAM's own idea and
 * removing it here would be throwing away the differentiator.
